        Welcome to Classic Swaggos, one of the many projects on Ethereum
        Classic. We're working to become the supreme decentralized community of
        Web3, by providing high value to our members and the Ethereum Classic
        ecosystem through community-led projects, connections and innovations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Classic Swaggos are a collection of 10,000 NFTâ€™s that have their own
        unique designs. There is a order of rarity that makes certain ones more
        valuable than the others. With minting these you have the chance of
        getting a super rare Swaggo. Rarity is not everything as some people may
        like a certain type of design for building a collection. Making minting
        these fun and exciting!
        <br />
        <br />
        Classic Swaggos are the second pixelated art on the Ethereum Classic
        blockchain, everyone can get a Swaggo if they mint before all 10,000 are
        sold out. Each Swaggo will cost the same amount which is 2etc.
        <br />
        <br />
        Many NFT projects are coming out for Ethereum Classic and were happy to
        create this for you guys. We want to see Ethereum Classic succeed and
        will do anything to make it happen. Mint away boys!!
